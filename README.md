# GlycoBreath: Breath-Based Biosensor for Hyperglycemia Detection  

**Senior Design Project | Florida International University**  
**Sponsor:** ARDIG Technologies, Inc.  

---

## üìñ Project Overview  

GlycoBreath is a **non-invasive, breath-based biosensor prototype** developed as part of my Biomedical Engineering Senior Design project. The device is designed to detect **hyperglycemia in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes** by analyzing **acetone and ammonia biomarkers** in exhaled breath.  

This project was developed in collaboration with **ARDIG Technologies, Inc.**, who supported the design and provided resources for prototyping and testing.
